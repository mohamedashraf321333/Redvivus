        <p class="image-text">Plastic is incredibly useful in modern life, but its widespread use may impair human sustainability. The production and disposal of plastic generates greenhouse gases and hazardous waste. Examples of plastic wastes: usually only bottles, tubs, and jugs (for example, salad containers, berry boxes, or clamshell packages).</p>

        <p class="image-text">Organic waste is common in almost all households. This waste consists of food waste, garden waste, and so on. While this waste is broken down by micro-organisms over time, it still needs to be appropriately disposed of when generated.

        <p class="image-text">The recycling of paper is the process by which waste paper is turned into new paper products. It saves waste paper from occupying homes of people and producing methane as it breaks down. Because paper fibre contains carbon , recycling keeps the carbon locked up for longer and out of the atmosphere.</p>

        <p class="image-text">Glass recycling is the processing of waste glass into usable products. Glass that is crushed or imploded and ready to be remelted is called cullet. The most common colours used for consumer containers are clear glass, green glass, and brown glass. Glass is ideal for recycling since none of the material is degraded by normal use.</p>
